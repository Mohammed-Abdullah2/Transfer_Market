### Project Description
#### Input Fields
##### The application uses the following inputs:

- Average goals per match: Reflects the player's scoring ability.
- Average assists per match: Highlights the player's role in creating scoring opportunities.
- Total matches played: Indicates the player's experience.
- Fitness rating: Tracks physical readiness or injury concerns.
- International caps: Demonstrates international exposure.
- Transfer interest: Considers market demand for the player.
#### Machine Learning Model
* The predictive model is trained using XGBoost, a gradient-boosted decision tree framework known for its performance and efficiency.
The model uses historical player data to learn patterns and predict market prices accurately.*
